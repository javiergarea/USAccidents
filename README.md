# Traffic accidents analysis using Apache Spark and Google Colab
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11f79ql5Fw9P5Ah3YmEzaZOVYakaVcga2?usp=sharing)

This project consists in a statistical analysis of a large traffic accidents dataset [[1, 2]](##References) using Spark.

It has been developed using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)'s environment. For this purpose, both Jupyter Notebook and Dataset had been hosted using Google Drive.

You can run the code in my [hosted notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11f79ql5Fw9P5Ah3YmEzaZOVYakaVcga2?usp=sharing) or upload setup your own working environment following the next section steps.

## How to setup the working environment

Set the environment performing the following steps:

1. Create the `Colab Notebooks` and `Colab Datasets` folders in your Google Drive space.
2. Import the [`USAccidents.ipynb`](https://github.com/javiergarea/USAccidents/blob/master/USAccidents.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook into your `Colab Notebooks` folder.
3. Download the [USAccidents dataset](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents) and import it into your `Colab Datasets` folder.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab.

> GitHub's Jupyter Notebook renderer does not display the plots generated by [plot.ly](https://plot.ly/).
