# Traffic accidents analysis using Apache Spark and Google Colab

This project consists in a statistical analysis of a large traffic accidents dataset [[1, 2]](##References) using Spark.

## How to run the code

The project has been developed using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)'s environment. For this purpose, both Jupyter Notebook and Dataset had been hosted using Google Drive. 

Set the environment performing the following steps:

1. Create the `Colab Notebooks` and `Colab Datasets` folders in your Google Drive space.
2. Import the [`USAccidents.ipynb`](https://github.com/javiergarea/USAccidents/blob/master/USAccidents.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook into your `Colab Notebooks` folder.
3. Download the [USAccidents dataset](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents) and import it into your `Colab Datasets` folder.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab.

> GitHub's Jupyter Notebook renderer does not display the plots generated by [plot.ly](https://plot.ly/).
